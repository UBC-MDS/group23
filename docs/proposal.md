### Research Questions and Usage Scenarios

Tanimose is a new intern at netflix and works in the business strategy division. He is appointed by the team lead to come up with a proposal
on how to drive the customer's consumption of netflix movies and TV shows based on ratings. The available data lead him to the following ask questions: 

- Over the years, what new ratings ( TV and movie ratings) were introduced to netflix and how have they increased or decreased?
- How has the average duration of the movies or series in each rating increased over the years?
- Are there trigger words in the titles of the movies or/and series that have been persistent in ratings?

Tanimose believes these questions would inform the excutive boards on what movies or TV shows to include or remove based on ratings.
