# Netflix Dashboard App

This app provides easy access to information related to types of movies and TV shows available on Netflix. This information could be useful to companies providing online streaming services for creating and designing their content catalog. A detailed description of the dashboard and its potential usage can be found in the [proposal document](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/netflixpy_dashboard/blob/minor-changes/docs/proposal.md).


## Description
The app contains a landing page that shows the distribution (bar, line or density chart) of movie or TV show release year, country, director and duration. User can filter the plots by selecting a date range and selecting to include movie or TV show or both by clicking the radial button. User can also select multiple countries or directors from dropdown lists for comparison between different countries or directors. As well, by dragging a range of years in the release year plot, the user can further filter the country, director, and duration plots to a smaller subset of data reflecting the selected range of years.
