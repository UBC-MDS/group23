# Dashboard App

Data visualization project for DSCI 532 (Data Visualization II); a
course in the Master of Data Science program at the University of
British Columbia.

## Description
This app contains a landing page that shows the distribution (bar, line or density chart) of the release year, country, director and duration for a movie or TV show.  This app also contains a plot for the number of movies or TV shows over the release year, as well as plots for the number of movies or TV shows for different countries or directors.  Other plots included in this app are plots for the counts of movies or TV shows versus their duration (separate plots for movies and TV shows, where movie duration will be a continuous scale while TV show duration will be a discrete scale).  Users can filter the plots by selecting a date range and selecting to include movies, TV shows, or both by clicking the radial button.  Users also have the option to select multiple countries or directors from dropdown menus for comparison between the number of movies for different countries or directors.  Additionally, by dragging a range of years in the release year plot, users can further filter the country, director, and duration plots to a smaller subset of data reflecting the selected range of years.
